# freeflow

Author: Vir Karan

This is an implementation of the non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration approach described in Freitas et. al. [1] and Menon et. al. [2], but written to use jobflow and atomate2. So far, only LAMMPS is supported as the backend, and most of the jobs/flows are probably buggy. This will be updated with what works when I finish testing everything!
